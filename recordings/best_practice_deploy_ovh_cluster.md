# Demo Moving to OVHcloud MongoDB Managed from an Existing MongoDB Instance

## 1. Setting Up OVHcloud MongoDB Managed Instance
- **1.0 Size your cluster**
- **1.1 Creating a MongoDB Service in OVHcloud**
  - Step-by-step walkthrough of creating a MongoDB service in OVHcloud
  - Configuring instance parameters
- **1.2 Access and Security Configuration**
  - Setting up user roles and permissions
  - Configuring network access and IP whitelisting

## 2. Introducing Migration tools
- **2.1 mongodump and mongorestore (already discussed)**
- **2.1 Overview of MongoSync**
  - Introduction to MongoSync and its purpose
  - Key features and benefits
  - Basic setup and configuration
- **2.2 Overview of Kafka Connector**
  - Introduction to Kafka Connector for MongoDB
  - Key features and benefits
  - Basic setup and configuration
- **2.3 Demonstration**
  - Practical demo of integrating Kafka Connector with MongoDB

## 3. Migration Execution Process
- **3.1 Initial Backup**
  - Using `mongodump` to create a backup of the existing MongoDB instance
  - Ensuring the backup is stored securely
- **3.2 Migrate Data**
  - Transferring the backup data to the OVHcloud instance with the chosen migration tool
    
- **3.3 Switching Over**
  - **Continuous Synchronization**: If using `mongosync`  mentioned in the [previous section](https://github.com/ralphsawaya/ovh/blob/main/MongoDoc/mongodb_03_Move%20to%20OVHcloud%20mongoDB%20managed%20from%20an%20existing%20mongoDB%20instance/guide.en-gb.md#migration-tools), which offer continuous synchronization, monitor the synchronization logs.
  - **Identify Synchronization Lag**: Wait until the logs indicate that the target cluster is only a few seconds behind (e.g., 2 seconds) the source cluster.
  - **Stop Writes to Source Cluster**: At this point, stop all write operations to the source cluster to ensure no data loss.
  - **Update Application Configuration**: Change the application configuration to point to the new OVH cloud cluster.
  - **Deploy Changes**: Deploy the updated configuration to your application.
  - **Restart Application**: Restart the application to begin using the new OVH cloud target cluster.
    
- **3.4 Verification**
  - Verifying the data integrity after the transfer
  - Running basic queries to ensure data consistency
